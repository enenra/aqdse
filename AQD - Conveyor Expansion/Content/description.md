This mod adds several new conveyor tube shapes, as well as armored versions of all conveyor tubes to the game, allowing you more freedom when designing your conveyor systems. It also adds other miscellaneous conveyor-related blocks, such as the Conveyor Access, which is a half-block of the size of an air vent that allows you to access your cargo network without having to place a cargo container.

[h1]General notes[/h1]
[list]
[*]Green / Yellow indicators for connectivity are iffy. This is unfortunately a limitation within Keen's emissive code that only supports up to two connections for conveyor tubes.
[*]I will add additional blocks to the pack but I'm as of now not comitting to adding additional conveyor shapes. I've got some ideas there but I think what I've got in now covers most use cases and at some point, adding too many shapes will make using all of them more annoying.
[*]The conveyors are only for large grid. I don't currently have plans to make versions for small grid.
