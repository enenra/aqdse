This mod changes ore deposits on planets to be further below the surface but also much larger. It further also changes ore distribution: Now certain ores can only be found on specific planets, and what resources can be found in asteroids is greatly reduced.

[h1][b]AQD - A Quantum of Depth[/b] is a project of mine, encompassing multiple small and larger mods aimed at improving the gameplay experience and eventually overhauling larger parts of the game:[/h1]

[h1]Planet ore deposits[/h1]
Ore deposits on planets have been altered. They are much, much larger than in vanilla but have also largely been moved further down into the ground. As a result, it is much more worth to build permanent mining outposts.

Ore depth is determined by their "tier":
[list]
[*][b]Tier 1[/b]: Iron, Nickel, Silicon - 50-300m
[*][b]Tier 2[/b]: Cobalt, Magnesium, Silver - 200-800m
[*][b]Tier 3[/b]: Gold, Platinum, Uranium - 400-1000m
[/list]
Lower tier ores may still appear at lower depths, however.

[h1]Ore distribution[/h1]
Ore distribution has been altered significantly. The goal is to add a reason to visit all planets, which is achieved by distributing ores over the different planets. The distribution is designed with a start on the earthlike planet in mind, but with the economy update you may be able to make any planet work - or even a space start.

[*]I recommend using [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1814735276]AQD - Planetary Respawn Rovers[/url] together with this mod. It will allow you to more easily start out in a good spot close to the now harder to reach ore deposits.
[*]As of patch 1.1 this mod does not directly edit the vanilla planets anymore. As a result, it is compatible with other mods changing the vanilla planets.

[*]This mod is inspired by [b]Chrido[/b]'s ([url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=831739660]Scarce Resources[/url]) as well as [b]Ghost722nd[/b]'s ([url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1540170706]DeepOres[/url]) mods. I really liked their ideas but wanted to make some changes that better suited my vision for how it should be set up. Hence this mod.

[i]9 out of 10 dentists recommend you use [b]AQD - Vanilla Ore Distribution[/b] in your savegame

"I was playing with unmodded ore distribution like a dummy but then I discovered [b]AQD - Vanilla Ore Distribution[/b] and it changed my life!"[/i]

Read how one user experienced gameplay in this mod designed to force players to start out on Earth and then progress through planets and find all the ores:
