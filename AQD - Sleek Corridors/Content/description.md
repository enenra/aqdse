This mod adds a selection of passage blocks / corridor blocks to the game that are much sleeker than the existing vanilla and DLC ones. They are based on the corridors in the game [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/264710/Subnautica/]Subnautica[/url] and have a smooth, minimalistic and futuristic design you might also find in Sci-Fi universes like Mass Effect or Star Trek.

[h1]6 Sleek Corridor Blocks[/h1]
These blocks are large grid only (no plans to change this) and while they can be painted, they do not support skins. This is not a matter of being able to or not, but a conscious choice by me: I do not like the way skins look on the block. As such, I do not plan to change this either.

[*]I will likely expand the list of blocks in the future, but I will not just add variations for the sake of it. Any additions will be considered carefully and I'm not looking to add more than a handful of additional blocks.
