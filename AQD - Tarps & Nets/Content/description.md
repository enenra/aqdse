This mod adds a number of tarp and cargo net blocks to the game. They serve as great decorative options for your base, especially if you're going for a more industrial or ramshackle look. The cloth of the tarp-variants is even slightly animated. The mod also includes some pillars to hold up your tarps.

Tarp blocks can be painted and even support skins. They are also animated and will wave slightly - moreso if the weather is stormy.

The mod furthermore includes two pillar blocks - one full-sized and one half-sized, matching up to the points where the tarps and cargo nets are attached.

[*]I will likely add small grid versions of these blocks in the future.
