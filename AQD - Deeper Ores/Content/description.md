This mod increases the size of ore depots on planets and moons but also moves them further down into the surface. It works with all planets, modded too, and with all vanilla ores. The goal is to encourage players to build proper mining outposts as resources in one location last longer.

[h1]Deeper ore veins on all planets[/h1]
All ore veins are moved deeper into the planets. How deep depends on the type of ore - "starter" ores like iron, silicon and nickel are located 50m below ground. Cobalt and magnesium can be found 100 and 200m below ground respectively. Silver and gold are located at 300m, platinum and uranium at 400m below ground. The size of the veins varies depending on the ore as well, generally becoming smaller, the more "rare" an ore is (but at minimum still larger than vanilla deposits).

[*]This mod technically works with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1845977557]AQD - Vanilla Ore Distribution[/url], but as they both do similar things, they will overwrite each others settings.
[*]I would recommend using either a mod increasing the ore detector range or the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1978894018][VSI] Ore Deposit Scanner[/url] by Darkmist to make identifying the content of an ore spot easier.
