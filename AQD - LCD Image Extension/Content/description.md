This is a small extension to the available LCD images in Space Engineers. The aim is to add a couple of fairly general images as the vanilla game is fairly limited in this area. They are all styled after the pre patch 1.90 LCD images with the aim of fitting seamlessly into the game.

[*]As I prefer the LCD image style from before patch 1.90, I've included the old LCD textures for the images already contained within the game and thus overwrite them with the old ones. This also means that I don't need to redo all of my LCD images.
[*]The welder and grinder symbols are styled after the ingame ship tools. I tried using the hand tools at a base but didn't like the result. I may redo the drill one in line with the other two in the future.
[*]I may extend the images available in the future. If you have any suggestions, you're very much welcome to post them for me to consider but the idea of this is a fairly limited mod. I'm not aiming to add dozens of images with this.
