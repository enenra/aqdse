This mod adds a selection of concrete and reinforced concrete blocks to the game. These use the Concrete Skin textures but are built with concrete, which is made from gravel. The blocks' textures are connected when placed next to each other, just like armor blocks. Furthermore, adding this mod to your savegame will disable the Concrete Skin as these blocks act as a replacement.

[h1]12 New Concrete Blocks[/h1]
Available only in large grid, concrete blocks are very cheap and durable but extremely heavy. All block shapes exist in two variations - Concrete and Reinforced Concrete:
[list]
[*]Concrete Block
[*]Concrete Slope
[*]Concrete Corner
[*]Concrete Inverted Corner
[*]Concrete Half Block
[*]Concrete Half Block Slope
[/list]

[h1]Integrated into the Game[/h1]
These concrete blocks use Keen's armor system, meaning that their textures are connected across blocks placed next to each other. The concrete blocks also represent a much-needed sink for gravel, as the concrete component that the blocks are largely made of requires gravel to be produced. Furthermore, as these blocks would be rather pointless if the concrete skin could achieve the same look, this mod disables the Concrete Skin from being used.

[*]The amount of block shapes is highly unlikely to grow in the future. I might add one or two more blocks, but please do not send me requests for more additions.
