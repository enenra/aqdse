This mod contains one larger gyroscope and several upgrade modules to increase the output of the existing gyros. The new gyroscope is intended to be used on large ships to reduce the need for huge amounts of standard gyroscopes, saving both space and improving aesthetics. Additionally, all Gyroscopes are now animated in accordance with the grid's movement.

[h1]Large Gyroscope[/h1]
The Large Gyroscope is a 3x3x3 block which features a higher performance than the same volume of standard gyros. It furthermore has four upgrade module slots for the new Gyro Upgrade Modules, which increase its output even further. Only available for large grid.

The Large Gyro occupies a 27-block-volume and has roughly 30x the power of a normal Gyro. The Gyro Upgrade Modules increase its output by 1.4x each.

[h1]Gyro Booster[/h1]
The Gyro Booster features four mounting points for the existing gyroscopes. If placed on such a mounting point, the output of the gyro is increased. Available for both small and large grid.

The Gyro Booster increases the output of any vanilla Gyro mounted to it by 2x while taking up a volume of 2 blocks.

[*]The gyro performance increase through Gyro Upgrade Modules and Gyro Boosters is currently not listed in the terminal beyond its Max Required Power being increased. This will require additional scripting.
[*]I do not intend to add a small grid version of the large gyroscope or its upgrade modules.
[*]I've included compatibility with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2307652535]AQD - Vanilla Tech Tree[/url], so it should integrate seamlessly.
