[h1]Patch 1.7[/h1]
[list]
[*]Added Slope Transition, Half Slope Transition and Slab Slope Transition blocks.
[*]Removed all armor plates from the G menu since Keen implemented their own. The blocks are still ingame - and thus won't break any builds - but you won't be able to build more of them.
[*]Fix for mountpoints on Inverted Corner Split and Slab Corner Split being too large.
[*]Swapped 3x1 and 4x1 slope blocks to use a slightly different texture. The creases will now stand out less and interact with some skins slightly differently.
