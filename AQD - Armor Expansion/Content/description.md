This mod adds a number of new armor blocks and armor plates to the game. They are all available in light / heavy and large / small variation and have full armor skin support.

[h1][b]AQD - A Quantum of Depth[/b] is a project of mine, encompassing multiple small and larger mods aimed at improving the gameplay experience and eventually overhauling larger parts of the game:[/h1]

[h1]13 New Armor Blocks[/h1]

[h1]Full Skin Support[/h1]
To my knowledge, most other armor block mods don't currently support armor skins. This is not surprising, considering most of them are fairly old by now. This mod has been designed from ground-up to fully support armor skins.

[*]I am [b]NOT[/b] taking requests for more armor shapes. There will always be more to add - and I will add more in the future - but I will never be able to add all of them. I'd rather focus on a small amount that is of high quality and as universally applicable as possible.
[*]As it is not possible to add new deformation shapes to the game, and using the existing ones would not yield good results for some of these shapes, these blocks unfortunately do not support deformation.
[*]Klime made an [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2129594594]Armor Replacer[/url] mod, which allows the easy change from AQD blocks to their new vanilla counterparts.
