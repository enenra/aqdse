This mod rebalances various aspects of combat in SE. Armor health as well as block health in general is buffed and the various weapons are brought more in line with sensible values.

[h1]Block HP Rebalance[/h1]
Light armor block now receives 0.5x damage and 0.2x deformation. Heavy armor receives 0.5x damage and 0.15x deformation.
[list]
[*]Less deformation means less adjacent blocks get instantly destroyed by any amount of deformation.
[*]Light armor is not completely useless anymore (small grid light armor used to have 100HP, while a single gatling shot did 150HP of damage).
[/list]

Steel Plate and Interior Plate integrity doubled.
[list]
[*]Blocks derive their HP from the components they're built from. Increasing the HP of these components results in a general increase in block health.
