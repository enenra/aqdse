This mod rebalances various aspects of combat in SE. Armor health as well as block health in general is buffed and the various weapons are brought more in line with sensible values.

[h1][b]AQD - A Quantum of Depth[/b] is a project of mine, encompassing multiple small and larger mods aimed at improving the gameplay experience and eventually overhauling larger parts of the game:[/h1]

[h1]Block HP Rebalance[/h1]
Light armor block now receives 0.5x damage and 0.2x deformation. Heavy armor receives 0.5x damage and 0.15x deformation.
[list][*]Less deformation means less adjacent blocks get instantly destroyed by any amount of deformation.
[*]Light armor is not completely useless anymore (small grid light armor used to have 100HP, while a single gatling shot did 150HP of damage).
[/list]

Steel Plate and Interior Plate integrity doubled.
[list][*]Blocks derive their HP from the components they're built from. Increasing the HP of these components results in a general increase in block health.
[/list]

[h1]Gatling Rebalance[/h1]
Decrease in Small Gatling Gun ROF and increase in Large Gatling Turret ROF.
[list][*]Small Gatling Gun ROF is now the same as the Small Gatling Turret. Sharp decrease in DPS.
[/list]

[i](Note that missile DPS is inaccurate because it doesn't take AOE damage in consideration.)[/i]

General increase in gatling accuracy.
[list][*]More accuracy means less damage spread over whole grids, which can actually help survivability.
[/list]

[h1]Rifle Rebalance[/h1]
Rifle damage was halved because their DPS rivalled that of Large Gatling Turrets.
