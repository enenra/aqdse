This mod changes the skybox to one ideally suited for creative building. It features a dark grey background with grid lines and axi labels in their corresponding colors, giving the appearance of a modelling application such as Blender.

[h1]New Skybox[/h1]
This skybox features a grid as a background, with axi denoted by label and color. The mod by SISK which is listed as a dependency is loaded automatically and will remove the sun sprite, as it has been replaced entirely by stronger ambient light. Together with the dark grey background color, this makes the skybox very comfortable to look at for extended periods of time.
