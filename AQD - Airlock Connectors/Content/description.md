This mod adds airlock connectors in two sizes to the game. Airlock connectors can be used to create airtight connections between grids without using merge blocks. They can only be connected to other airlock connectors of the same type.

[*]I have no plans to add additional sizes or variants of airlock connectors in the future.
[*]The flat airlock connector only transmits power - it is not conveyored. The large connector is conveyored.
[*]Airtightness is somewhat janky - there's not much that can be done about it, unfortunately.
