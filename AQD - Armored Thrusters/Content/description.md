This mod adds a complete set of armored thrusters to the game. While it's certainly not the first mod of its kind, a lot of armored thruster mods seem to be based on the old DX9 models. This mod is based on the DX11 thruster models and as a result fits in neatly with the existing vanilla blocks.

[h1]A complete set of armored thrusters[/h1]
For every ion, hydrogen and atmospheric thruster, there are two variants:
[list]
[*]Armored
[*]Armored Slope
[/list]
For atmospheric thrusters, there are is an additional variant that has the slope on the exhaust part of the block as of patch 0.7d .

[h1]Tiered Thrusters (via additional mod)[/h1]
While this mod does not include tiered thrusters, if you would like to have something akin to tiered thrusters, consider giving Meridius' [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1660726401]Adjustable Thruster Multipliers[/url] a try. It adds sliders to all thrusters to increase thrust, while also increasing energy / fuel consumption at the same time.

[h1]Regarding more blocks / the existing blocks[/h1]
[list]
[*]I currently have no plans to extend this set with additional shapes due to the immense amount of work involved.
[*]The thrusters not using the armor textures is intentional. It's unfortunately not possible to make the textures line up properly with surrounding armor so I've decided to instead go with this look.
[/list]
[h1]Work in progress[/h1]
[list]
[*]While the mod looks visually complete, it's still missing some optimizations and adjustments. None of the models currently have properly adjusted hitboxes, LOD models, or their own build stage models. Nevertheless it's in a stage where it's perfectly playable. Future updates will add those elements.
[*]I've added additional Steel Plates as requirements for building all of these blocks. This will also add durability to the blocks. But how many are added is likely currently fairly unbalanced. Should you have feedback regarding the amount of Steel Plates in a block, I'd love to hear it.
