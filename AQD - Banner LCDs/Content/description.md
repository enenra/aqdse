This mod adds several "Banner LCD" blocks, which are essentially transparent LCDs. However, they have no frame and can only be placed flat on surfaces. Like normal LCDs, these banners allow you to display text as well as LCD images. This means you can now easily put the name of your ships on their flanks, and of course also place a huge version of your faction's logo on the walls of your base.

[*]I strongly recommend you check out Whiplash141's [url=https://forum.keenswh.com/threads/tool-whips-image-to-lcd-converter.7393443/]Image To LCD Converter[/url]. This app allows the conversion of image files you have on your PC into code that can be pasted into LCD text fields. This will then make the LCDs show your image ingame. No mods required.
[*]Also consider giving my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1645942623]AQD - LCD Image Extension[/url] mod a try. It adds a number of additional images that can be displayed on LCDs, including banner LCDs.
