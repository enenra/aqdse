[h1]Fixes[/h1]
[list]
[*]Drop container parachutes open too late on higher speed settings, as a result they crash into planets.
[*]Respawn pods and rovers open up their parachutes at higher altitutes to prevent crashing.
[*]Grinder and welder block ranges have been adjusted: no more leftover small blocks lying directly on the grinders, but not getting ground down.
