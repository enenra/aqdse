# **AQD - A Quantum of Depth** is a project of mine, encompassing multiple small and larger mods aimed at improving the gameplay experience and eventually overhauling larger parts of the game:

# Fixes
* Drop container parachutes open too late on higher speed settings, as a result they crash into planets.
* Respawn pods and rovers open up their parachutes at higher altitutes to prevent crashing.
* Grinder and welder block ranges have been adjusted: no more leftover small blocks lying directly on the grinders, but not getting ground down.

# Adjustments
* Added new camera and turret overlays to allow for more precise aiming.
* Changed gatling and auto cannon tracers to be significantly more visible.
* Ore detector ranges have been increased from 150 to 350 and 50 to 150.
