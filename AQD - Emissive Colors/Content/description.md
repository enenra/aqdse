This mod changes the colors of the emissives on all blocks. Emissives are the glowy bits indicating a block's status. In vanilla these are extremely saturated. This mod desaturates them to achieve a less cartoon-y look and attempting to emulate the colors in use in the render on the thumbnail.

[*]Some mods set emissive colors manually. This generally results in the colors being set to the vanilla emissive values, and not the ones this mod introduces. There's unfortunately not much that can be done about that.
