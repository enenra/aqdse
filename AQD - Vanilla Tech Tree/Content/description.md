This mod adds a tech tree to the game which has been created by considering all vanilla blocks. It does not lock all vanilla blocks behind technologies but attempts to create a sensible progression through the available ones, while encouraging the use of the less commonly used blocks. This mod is designed to be used with the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2307650528]AQD - Research[/url] mod.

[list]
[*]Technologies are separated into 4 tiers, based on the type of Research Material required to research them.
[*]Research Material is produced in the assembler with ingots of various metals. Better Research Material is required for higher tier technologies, which unlock better blocks.

[*]The amount of Research Material required to research a technology as well as the time it takes is still highly work in progress. I'm looking for feedback on these values and very much open to adjusting them.
